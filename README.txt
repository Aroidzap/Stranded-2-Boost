Stranded 2 Boost
================

About:
It's a Stranded II source modification + library.
The main goals are to fix Alt-Tabbing and boost overall performance.
Plus maybe additional improvements in future.
It should also provide you easy way to make your own modifications to Stranded II source and extend it with C/C++ code.

Recommended tool:
Visual Studio 2015 (https://www.visualstudio.com/)

Building:
If you have modified only Stranded 2 Boost, it should be enough to build Stranded2Boost project.
If you have modified Stranded II sources, you should build Stranded2Source project.
If you have any problems, try to build solution, or rebuild solution.
All batch files should be called automatically when building.

FAQ:
After launching StrandedII.exe I got "User lib not found." message.
- Check if "Stranded2Boost.dll" and "StrandedII.exe" are in same folder.
Icon seems not to be updating.
- You have to rebuild your icon cache. (Restarting your PC should help.)
I'm not developer, just Stranded II player. Where can i get StrandedII.exe?
- This modification and library is still under development. Binary files will be released as soon as everything will be working properly.
I want to play "The Survivalist" mod with this.
- Support is planned in future, but it depends on other people than just me.
There are no updates for a long time.
- Well... I'm doing this only in my free time :P
